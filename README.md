# 👋 Hi, I’m Martin Kibsgaard

## 👨‍💻 Software Developer in the Making | Cybersecurity Enthusiast | Proud Father

I’m a Computer Science student (Datamatiker) at Erhvervsakademi Aarhus with a unique background as an operational dog handler in the Danish Armed Forces. My life has taught me the value of structure, responsibility, and perseverance – qualities I bring into every line of code I write and every project I touch.

My biggest motivation is my 3-year-old daughter. She reminds me daily why I strive to build a life rooted in stability, integrity, and purpose – both professionally and personally.
